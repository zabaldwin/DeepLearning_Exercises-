# DeepLearning_Exercises
This repository contains deep learning applications from ranging complexities using both PyTorch and TensorFlow.

Provided examples touch on the main concepts that are necessary to understanding Deep Learning and include:

  1) Basic fundamental neural network w/ the Iris dataset
  2) Experiment w/ activation functions utilizing the FashionMNIST dataset
  3) Perform image classification using a DNN w/ the MNIST dataset | _TensorFlow_
  4) Perform image classification (with hyper-parameter tunning) using a CNN w/ the CIFAR-10 dataset | _PyTorch_
  5) Generate realistic numbers by training a GAN w/ the MNIST dataset | _TensorFlow_
  6) Generate and mix Spherical Harmonics to train a CNN to aid in classifying mixed wavesets | _TensorFlow_
  7) Use simulated data from a ROOT TTree to train an AutoEncoder to detect anomolies | _TensorFlow_
