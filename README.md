# DeepLearning_Exercises
This repository contains deep learning applications from ranging complexities using both PyTorch and TensorFlow (and one simple try with JAX).

Provided examples touch on the main concepts that are necessary to understanding Deep Learning and include:

  1) Basic fundamental neural network w/ the Iris dataset
  2) Experiment w/ activation functions utilizing the FashionMNIST dataset
  3) Perform image classification using a DNN w/ the MNIST dataset | _TensorFlow_
  4) Perform image classification (with hyper-parameter tunning) using a CNN w/ the CIFAR-10 dataset | _PyTorch_
  5)
