## Requirements
Each process was ran with Python3.11. See the provided [requirements file](requirements.txt) for each the Python requirements.

## Usage
```shell
$ python3.11 <script>.py
```

Each python script was made as simple as possible such that just to utilize any script, simply invoke Python 3.11 followed by the name of the Python script (e.g., <script>.py). The process entails no distinctive steps beyond running the Python interpreter and specifying the script file (except when wanting to change already set hyperparameters).
